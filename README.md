## Project Overview
The Bank Loan Analysis project aims to provide comprehensive insights into lending operations through three distinct dashboards. Dashboard 1, "Summary," focuses on key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total loan applications, funded amount, and average interest rates, facilitating a thorough assessment of lending activities. Dashboard 2, "Overview," employs various charts to analyze monthly trends, regional disparities, loan terms, and borrower profiles, enhancing understanding of lending patterns and dynamics. Dashboard 3, "Details," offers a consolidated view of essential loan metrics and data points, serving as a user-friendly interface for accessing detailed insights into loan portfolios and borrower profiles. Through these dashboards, the project aims to empower financial institutions to make informed, data-driven decisions and optimize lending strategies.
